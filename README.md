# web-scraping-beer-data

This project is a "helper project" for the Beer Recommendation Project. It is fairly straightforward; 
 I scrape data from LCBO and attempt to create a data set mapping a list of random people to the beers they like and/or dislike. I will then use this data set for the Beer Recommendation Project.

I had never learned web scraping before, so I learned along the way. I first tried using BeautifulSoup, but realized it was incorrectly reading the html code on LCBO's webstie so decided to switch to something else (TBD).
